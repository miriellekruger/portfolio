Great adoration or obsession? Who knows but ya girl likes plants! 

Ever since I was a kid, from climbing trees to eating dandelions in my yard, I have loved cultivating, consuming, and learning about plants. 

Aquaponics is a method of growing plants using nutrients transformed from the excrement of fish that my father and I utilized with a greenhouse we built during my high school years.  I later developed a series of prototypes for smaller spaces when I lived in apartment spaces.
