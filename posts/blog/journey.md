### TLDR: Chemical Engineer -> Manufacturing Intern -> NASA Trash Research Engineer -> Patent Agent -> SWE...?

My journey in college began with a deep curiosity about understanding the world around me, and I believed that exploring the realm of chemicals would be the ideal way to explore this.  However, as I progressed through college and engaged in various internships, I came to the realization that my true potential for making a meaningful impact lay in my ability to transform data into valuable insights using software.  It was at this point that I recognized I had chosen the wrong major, but unfortunately, I was already heavily invested in a term-limited scholarship, making it difficult to switch paths.  Undeterred, I resolved to broaden my knowledge by enrolling in as many computer science classes as possible.  However, it became apparent that this alone would not be sufficient to secure a software engineering position.

Motivated by the desire to find an alternative route to align my skills and passions, I made a strategic pivot towards patent law and became a [patent agent](/posts/experiences/patents).  As a patent agent, I found myself at the intersection of innovation and law, interacting with inventors and their groundbreaking creations.  While this experience provided valuable insights and allowed me to interface with diverse technologies, I yearned for something more.  I desired to be more than a mere intermediary between inventors and their patents; I wanted to actively contribute to the process of creation and inventiveness myself.

Reflecting on the diversity of my experiences, I have come to realize that the impact I can make and the collaborations I engage in hold far greater significance to me than the specific field in which I work.  This understanding stems from various ventures, 
such as the time in high school when my father and I constructed a greenhouse, complete with aquaponics systems, with the noble aim of providing sustenance and employment opportunities to our community.  This project deeply resonated with me as it allowed me to spend cherished moments with my father, bring something into existence that would not have otherwise existed, and witness .

With humility, I acknowledge that I am relatively new to this field of software engineering.  While my life is not solely dedicated to developing apps or software, I am fueled by a thirst for knowledge, armed with a quick learning ability, and eagerly motivated to immerse myself in the world of coding.
