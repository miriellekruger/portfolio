### TLDR: Chemical Engineer → Manufacturing Intern → NASA Trash Research Engineer → Patent Agent → Coder Girl 

I began my college journey fueled by a deep curiosity about the world, initially focusing on the realm of chemicals. However, as I progressed through internships, including a valuable experience at [NASA](/posts/experiences/NASA), I discovered my true potential for making a meaningful impact lies in leveraging software to transform data into valuable insights. Despite being committed to a term-limited scholarship, I was undeterred in my pursuit of aligning my skills and passions. Thus, I enrolled in numerous computer science classes to broaden my knowledge. Yet, I soon realized that expanding my expertise alone would not be sufficient to secure a software engineering position.

Motivated to find an alternative route, I made a strategic pivot towards patent law and became a [patent agent](/posts/experiences/patents). This role placed me at the intersection of innovation and law, engaging with inventors and their groundbreaking creations. While this experience provided valuable insights and exposed me to diverse technologies, I yearned for a more active role in the process of creation and inventiveness.

Accordingly, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science to further enhance my ability to create and develop impactful technology. Through relevant coursework, such as [Data and Visual Analytics](/posts/experiences/dva), Machine Learning, and [Database Design](/posts/experiences/databases), I am expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in critical areas of the field. In addition, I have gained practical experience by independently and collaboratively developing various tools and web applications using languages like Python, JavaScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of software development and fortified my capacity to deliver innovative solutions.

Reflecting on the diverse range of my experiences, I have come to realize that the impact I can make and the collaborations I engage in hold greater significance to me than the specific field in which I work. This understanding stems from ventures like constructing a [greenhouse with aquaponics systems](/posts/blog/plants) during high school, which aimed to provide sustenance and employment opportunities to our community. This project not only allowed me to forge cherished memories with my father but also showcased my ability to bring something into existence that would have otherwise remained unrealized.

If you are passionate about making a meaningful impact, exploring innovative projects, and actively contributing to the process of creation, I invite you to connect with me. Together, let's explore possibilities, exchange ideas, and embark on a purpose-driven journey of innovation. Feel free to reach out if you share these values and are eager to make a difference.
