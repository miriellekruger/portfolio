## WORK EXPERIENCE
### [FIG. 1 Patents](/posts/experiences/patents)
Spokane, Washington\
Patent Agent	\
June 2021 – May 2022
- Revitalized subpar patent applications from various law firms into viable patents by strategically reimagining approaches according to clients' preferences, the core invention elements, and patent examiners' inclinations
- Formulated persuasive arguments endorsed by seasoned patent attorneys, effectively negotiating with stubborn patent examiners to surmount a subjective aspect of the law (35 U.S.C. § 101)
- Simultaneously managed and authored more than 10 patent applications, encompassing diverse software engineering subjects, highlighting adeptness in multitasking and a wide technical spectrum
### [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](/posts/experiences/NASA)
Kennedy Space Center, Florida\
Research Engineering Intern\
Jan. 2020 – Aug. 2020
- Developed a custom data analysis tool in Python, transforming raw system data into concise metrics and visual graphs, expediting meeting and decision-making times
- Streamlined experiment design by orchestrating intricate simulations of interconnected chemical subsystems, using a specialized chemical processes Python package (Cantera)
