## WORK EXPERIENCE
### [FIG. 1 Patents](/posts/experiences/patents)
Spokane, Washington\
Patent Agent	\
June 2021 – May 2022
- Authored, filed, and prosecuted multiple patent applications concurrently, primarily in the software and machine learning field.
- Created compelling visual representations to illustrate complex inventions of patent applications. 
- Advocated for patent application allowance by planning and conducting interviews with patent examiners. 
### [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](/posts/experiences/NASA)
Kennedy Space Center, Florida\
Research Engineering Intern	\
Jan. 2020 – Aug. 2020
- Designed and characterized subsystems and experiments for a waste gasification reactor system (OSCAR) to optimize performance and advance toward a technology demonstration in Low Earth Orbit.
- Built a data-driven modular fluid, heat, and kinetic model of subsystems of OSCAR to predict overall products and behaviors, using Cantera and SciPy in Python.
- Performed chemical analysis of reaction products using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography (GC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
- Generated custom automatic data analysis and visualization tools with Python to process raw data and analyze trends and key performance products to increase analysis efficiency 100-fold.
