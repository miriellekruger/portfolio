## Reunion: Rediscovering Community Through Sharing

Reunion is a community-building platform I developed to facilitate the exchange of gifts among people, emphasizing relationship-building over transactions.

### Development
- *Front-End Development:* I built the front end using React, leveraging various hooks to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Tailwind CSS was used to style the application, ensuring a clean and user-friendly design.
- *Back-End Development:* I implemented the back end with Supabase, developing a robust and scalable database structure. Custom SQL queries were written when necessary to handle complex data requirements efficiently.
- *Database Design:* I designed and structured the database to handle diverse data sets, ensuring optimized data retrieval and processing.
Debugging and Problem-Solving: Throughout the development process, I used Chrome Developer Tools and terminal-based debugging techniques to troubleshoot and resolve issues effectively.

### Learning Outcomes
- *React Proficiency:* I gained in-depth knowledge of React, mastering the use of hooks to manage state and effects, and creating seamless user interactions.
- *SQL and Data Processing:* I learned how to write efficient SQL queries and optimize data processing, even for smaller datasets, enhancing the performance and reliability of the application.
- *Generative AI vs. Traditional Resources:* By experimenting with generative AI for code assistance and comparing it with traditional resources like Stack Exchange and documentation, I identified the advantages and limitations of each approach.
- *Debugging Skills:* My debugging skills improved significantly, allowing me to quickly identify and fix issues using both terminal commands and browser developer tools.

### Technological Backbone
- *React:* Utilized for building the interactive front end, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.
- *Supabase:* Implemented as the back end for secure and scalable data management.
- *Tailwind CSS:* Employed for styling, providing a responsive and visually appealing design.
- *Custom SQL:* Developed to handle specific data requirements, optimizing data retrieval and processing.

### Project Impact
Reunion isn't just a platform for sharing items; it's a tool for rebuilding community connections. By developing this website, I created a space where people can share what they have, fostering trust and collaboration among community members. This project taught me the importance of efficient coding practices, effective debugging, and the power of combining modern web technologies to build impactful applications.
