#### Summary

This project aimed to develop a tool that demonstrates the impact of temperature, population change, and pollution on extreme precipitation.  We identified 75 weather stations across diverse environments in the continental United States (CONUS).  We collected data on extreme precipitation, population density, PM2.5 concentration, and temperature for each station.  

#### Purpose and Goal
The purpose of the project was to aid urban planners, farmers, and policy makers in assessing flood risk and water allocation in a changing climate.  The goal was to create a visualization for our analysis that effectively displayed this information to highlight various locations that are at more or less risk for flooding.

#### Spotlight
Data fetching posed challenges due to inconsistencies in climate data over the past 50 years, resulting in variations in data availability and the exclusion of certain climate features from analysis.  The team overcame these obstacles through meticulous data validation and preprocessing.
